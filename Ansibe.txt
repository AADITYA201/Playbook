Inventory: WHERE To Do the Changes
==============================

Inventory is a simple file which is available by default in ansible
The default name of inventory file -> hosts
This file is available in directory -> /etc/ansible
In this file we will write the list of IP address or hostnames of the servers where ansible has to make the changes
Only and only if the IP of the host is present in this file, ansible will be able to connect and make changes on it.
We can also create inventory file with any name in any location of the ansible controller
