###################################
docker show me ur all container process 
docker ps -a
docekr run ubuntu
docker ps -a

#######################
1.it flag attached 
Container should be created
cont should have a unique name
container should be running 
user root should br attached to th termina; of the container

docker run --name=container1 -it ubuntu (it :I is for interaction and t is for terminal)
#################################
come out of the container and keep it running
press CTRL key and pq
#####################
attach or move inside the container agaian
#docker attach cont1 (container name)

Start existing container 
#docker start cont1 (container name)

For stopping conytainer 
#docker stop cont1

#################################
2.-d deatached mode 
We will always lauched the container in the deatached mode
Container should be created
cont should have a unique name
container should be running 
user root  will not attached to th termina; of the container
container will continue to run in the background
user root will be on the VM terminal
# docker run nginx
exit /ctrl c
#docker run -d --name=web nginx

3.Execute a command on the container from the vm terminal itself

#docker exec web cat /etc/os-release
# docker exec web nginx -version

4.command for deleting all container #docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
5.After creating the container we need to acces it from the browser so for tha purpose we use port forwarding and it is used in detached mode 
#docker run -d --name web22 -P nginx 
-P is the flag for port forwarding 

then u will see in port section open free port id forwarding request to the container port and vm PORT  FOWARDED TO CONTAINER PORT.
*image is just an executable static file .

*When u pull the img it does not create a container for you.
#docker pull httpd (apache img)
#docker images
#docker ps -a (u can see container has not created)\
name of the img wil be always in the lower case.

Now u want a container apache on it the u will use
#docker run --name cont1apache -d -P httpd  (by using this container will create but It will run in background and u will be using ur terminal without going inside the container after creation because we use -d (detached mode) and u want  to acces the html page of webserver which comes bydefault by giving public ip and port number use -P (-P is use for port mapping so that we can access it from the browser of the machine)
*Once the container is created port mapping can not done so u have to delete it or recreate it.


Now you want to update that apache default page .....
1.Go inside the container and use exec cmd
#docker exec -it aaditya bash (aaditya is the container name & -it is for attaching it to the terminal)
2.after using docker exec -it aaditya bash,,cmd u will be in this /usr/local/apache2# directory.
3.Use #ls cmd 
4.that default html file will be in htdocs folder
5.#cd htdocs >ls>cat index.html>echo "        " >

docker run --name=container1 ubuntu (for naming the container )
for deleting 1 container;docker rm -f <container name/ID>
DELETE ALL CONTAINER :docker rm -f$(docker ps -a)
