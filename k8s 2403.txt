Deployment -> Allows us to update the image -> delete old pods with old image and create new pods with new image
here we are applying a default deployment strategy --> rolling update --> 
We have to give 2 parameters: maxSurge = how many new pods have to be created 
maxUnavailable = how many old pods have to be deleted
